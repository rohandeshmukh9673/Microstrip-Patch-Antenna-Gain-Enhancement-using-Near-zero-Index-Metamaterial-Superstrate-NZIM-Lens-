# Microstrip-Patch-Antenna-Gain-Enhancement-using-Near-zero-Index-Metamaterial-Superstrate-NZIM-Lens-
HFSS tool is used to design near-zero index metamaterial unit cell with PEC and PMC boundary conditions.
Metamerial superstrate is used to increase the gain of microstrip patch antenna by 2.05 dBi.
NZIM_idc_m_AS_ununited (hfss file) this file contains unit cell of near-zero index metamaterial.
Matrix of 7x7 of above mentioned unit cells is formed which is called as near-zero index metamaterial superstrate.
This superstrate is placed above the microstrip patch antenna to increse the gain of antenna at 5.2 GHz.
